Pursuit 10.5

This app is designed to use full crud functionality to create, obtain, update and delete data regarding financial transactions of various material or digital assets.

Transactions (tab) - allows you to see each transaction account in the database.

When you click on the link of an account, you will be directed to the Show page, which gives additional information about the account.

The Show Page will have buttons which allows you to go back to the previous page, edit the current account you are viewing, or delete the current account.

On the "New" tab, you will be directed to a page holding a form, which you can then add your own transactional data of whatever kind of asset you which to place. When you submit the data within the form, the page will direct you to the "transactions" page, to show you the current status of the database.

The Navigation page will present the total gross sum of all transactions within the database, and the Transactions page will present the number of accounts that currently exists within said database.

Note:  Additional features to the App may or may not recieve further updates.
